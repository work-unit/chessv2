Welcome to Chess Engine 230!

To run this package please perform the following steps:

Prepare Files
1. Unzip "lichess_elite_2020-06.pgn.zip"

Prepare Environment
1. Execute "./setup_environment.sh" to install environment 
   and open jupyter lab.

Preparing Data, Executing Model, and Analysis
1. Run the Chess_Engine_Network.ipynb.
NOTE: This takes a lot of time to run. In the second cell, you can
change GAME_COUNT to something on the order of 10-100 to execute
faster than what was done to generate the model.

We also prepared a chess game. If you would like to run this:
1. Run the "PlayEngine.ipynb" notebook.
2. Follow the progression of the notebook to play along.
NOTE: This is not a polished game so it is possible to break it
if you enter a wrong move. We hope you enjoy!

When you are finished with Chess Engine 230, you may remove
the environment by doing the following:
1. Execute "./remove_environment.sh"

Thank you for an excellent quarter.

The Chess Engine 230 Team,

Jonah Breslow and Jeff Kagan
